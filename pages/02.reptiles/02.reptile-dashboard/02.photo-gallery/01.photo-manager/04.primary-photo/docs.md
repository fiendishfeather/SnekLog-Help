##Overview
To set a Primary Photo, simply click the "Set Primary" button so it shows up on your Homepage & Reptile Dashboard. The primary photo is shown on the Photo Manager with a subtle outline as well as disabled "Set Primary" and "Delete" buttons.

>>> Primary photos cannot be deleted. If you want to delete a Primary Photo, you need to set another as Primary first.

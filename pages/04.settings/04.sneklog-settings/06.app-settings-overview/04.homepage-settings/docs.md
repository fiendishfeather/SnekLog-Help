###TimeZone
SnekLog stores everything you log in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) so it is very important that you select the proper Time Zone you are in so that all the conversions are done properly. 

>>>>> If you ever move or change location, simply update your Time Zone and SnekLog will adjust everything for you.

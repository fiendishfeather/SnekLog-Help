###TimeZone
SnekLog stores everything you log in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) so it is very important that you select the proper Time Zone you are in so that all the conversions are done properly. 

>>>>> If you ever move or change location, simply update your Time Zone and SnekLog will adjust everything for you.

###Reminder Timer
The Reminder Timer allows you the change the amount of time before an event is "Due" that the reminder icon appears on the home screen so you can see in advance upcoming events and prepare. The default is 24 hours, but you can choose anywhere between 0-24 in 3 hour increments

>>>>> For Example: By default, If you fed your Reptile on September 1st at 9:00pm with feeding interval of 7 days, the 'Feeding Due' icon will appear an September 6th at 9:01pm.

>>>>>> The developer of SnekLog does most of their feeding after sunset and uses 15 hours as their Reminder Timer so they can see who is due for food and pull feeders out in advance the day that a feeding is due.

See [Full Size Home](https://help.sneklog.com/home-pages/home-full) or [Compact Home](https://help.sneklog.com/home-pages/home-compact) for details.
